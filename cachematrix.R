## A matrix inversion is calculated, and then cached.  
## To save computation time, a repeated call of cacheSolve 
## does not recalculate - but returns the previous result. 


## makeCacheMatrix contains a list of functions to store
## the matrix, ...

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
